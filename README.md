This is an R package to automate some of the boring parts of adding newly registered voters during our April 2024 contract ratification vote. 

If you have never used R, I do not recommend trying to use this. If you are ready to go with R, you can install and use it as follows. 

```
remotes::install_github("ekernf01/reformatVoterList")
reformatVoterList:reformatVoterList("your/input/file.xlsx", "your/output/file.csv")
```
